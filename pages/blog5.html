            <p>Land development is a complex and multi-phased process, with each stage playing a critical role in ensuring the final development is high-quality and meets expectations. Here are the key stages of land development:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Feasibility Study and Site Selection:</strong> This is the starting point of land development, where developers conduct feasibility studies, including environmental impact assessments, market demand analysis, and legal compliance checks. Site selection decisions are based on the land's geographic location, surrounding infrastructure, and future development potential.</li>
                <li><strong>Planning and Design:</strong> Once the site is selected, the development team begins detailed planning and design. This includes land use planning, transportation layout, and public facility design. This stage also involves communication with local governments and communities to ensure the project aligns with urban planning and social needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Permitting and Approvals:</strong> After planning, the next step is obtaining various permits and approvals, such as building permits, environmental permits, and water resource management permits. This process often requires coordination with multiple government agencies and may involve public consultation and feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Construction:</strong> Once all necessary permits are obtained, developers can begin infrastructure construction. This includes building roads, electricity, water supply, and drainage systems. This stage provides the necessary support and foundation for subsequent construction activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Land Parceling and Sales:</strong> Finally, developers subdivide the land into individual parcels and prepare them for sale or lease to builders, real estate developers, or end-users. Each parcel is equipped with the necessary infrastructure and meets planning requirements, ready for further development or construction.</li>
            </ol>
