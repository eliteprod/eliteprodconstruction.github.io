            <p>Real estate development is a comprehensive process that transforms raw land or existing properties into residential, commercial, or industrial spaces. The process involves several key stages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Market Analysis and Site Acquisition:</strong> The first step in real estate development is conducting a market analysis to identify demand trends, potential target markets, and economic feasibility. Afterward, the developer acquires a suitable site that aligns with the project‚Äôs goals and market needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Concept Development and Design:</strong> With the site secured, developers and architects work together to create a concept and design for the project. This stage involves architectural planning, site layout, and integration of necessary amenities. The design must comply with local building codes and zoning regulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Planning and Funding:</strong> Real estate development requires significant capital investment. This stage involves detailed financial planning, including cost estimation, securing financing, and budget allocation. Developers often work with investors, banks, or other financial institutions to fund the project.</li>
                <li><strong>Construction and Management:</strong> Once funding is secured, the construction phase begins. This involves the actual building of the structures, along with site preparation, utility installation, and landscaping. Project management is crucial during this phase to ensure that construction stays on schedule, within budget, and meets quality standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing and Sales/Leasing:</strong> As construction progresses, developers begin marketing the property to potential buyers or tenants. This involves creating marketing materials, hosting open houses, and negotiating sales or lease agreements. The goal is to secure occupants before or shortly after project completion.</li>
                <li><strong>Completion and Handover:</strong> The final stage involves completing construction, ensuring all aspects of the project meet required standards, and obtaining a certificate of occupancy. The property is then handed over to buyers or tenants, marking the successful completion of the real estate development process.</li>
            </ol>
